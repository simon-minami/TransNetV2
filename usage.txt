1. run inference/transnetv2.py to get transition prediction
example usage:
# video/WVU_BUFF_test.mp4 is location of video you want to process
# --weights is for location of model
# --visualize is optional flag to create image visualization
python transnetv2.py video/WVU_BUFF_test.mp4 --weights inference/transnetv2-weights --visualize

Running this will output:
1. scenes.txt: contains prediction start and end frame numbers for distinct scenes
2. predictions.txt: contains probability of transition between each frame
3. vis.png: visualizations the transitions


2. run get_scenes.py to get video with scene numbers added
make sure to change the input and output paths accordingly
